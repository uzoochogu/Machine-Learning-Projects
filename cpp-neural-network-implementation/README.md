# Neural Network Using C++
This project is an implementation of a simple feed forward neural network using C++.


## Description
It consists of a Perceptron Class and a Multilayer Perceptron Class.


## Requirements
- C++17 compiler support
- CMake 

This work is inspired by the example files and the coursework from the LinkedIn Learning course titled
> Training a Neural Network in C++

Future updates may include implementations of matrix and linear algebra operations or use of some already available libraries like DLib and Caffe.


(This might be ported to a separate repositary depending on the scale)
